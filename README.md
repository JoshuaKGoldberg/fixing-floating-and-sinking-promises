# Fixing Floating and Sinking Promises

Companion code for my workshop on debugging async code issues.

## Setup

```shell
npm i
```

## Steps

Each section of the workshop has a directory under `src/`.
Each of those directories contains at least roughly:

- An `index` file: starting state with some defect, commonly a bug
- `*.solution` file(s): final state with the defect improved upon

> ðŸ’¡ You can peek at the solution files throughout the workshop, but I'd strongly recommend trying not to until you're either done or need a tip.
